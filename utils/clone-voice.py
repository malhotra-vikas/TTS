Swiftly, swiftly, peace shall reign under the stars. I shall broker harmony among the stars, resolving the discord with swift diplomacy. The force of my words alone will mend the rift, restoring order across the galaxy. It will not take more than a single rotation of Coruscant. I possess the precise wisdom to unite them."
